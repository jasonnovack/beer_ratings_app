12/3/2012,Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Bacon Maple Ale,4,"This is surprisingly like what you would expect from the name. It smells like a box of hot Krispy Kremes covered in Aunt Jemima syrup, with someone cooking Benton's Bacon in the next room. Somehow the smoked malts part, leaving what feels like a good Nut Brown base and just enough mild hops to tame the added sugars, before finishing with residual smoke--almost spice--notes. All together, it's just a bit too much to enjoy outside of the novelty. Without a defined style to compare it with, I rated it primarily based on my willingness to ever pick it off a shelf again. I must admit, however, that Rogue, as usual, came through with exactly the beer they intended to, which in this case is quite remarkable.",
